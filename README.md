# Garden Simulator

## Proposal

For my project, I want to create a garden simulator, in which the user may raise *several* varieties of plants!! Features
that will be implemented includes :

- Selecting between several different types of plants
- Watering and fertilizing the plant to make it grow
- Naming the plant!

This application could be used by anyone, likely plant enthusiasts and people who like similar types of games that 
have a 'raising' aspect. I used to play many simulator games, namely the cutesy ones that involve growing plants or
taking care of plants, which led me to want to make my own. I also greatly enjoy creating art, so I knew I wanted to be able to incorporate my own drawings in some way, which I 
can definitely do for this project!

## User Stories

- As a user, I want to add a plant to a collection of plants
- As a user, I want to be able to select between a variety of plants
- As a user, I want to be able to add water to the plant
- As a user, I want to see the plant grow after giving it care
- As a user, I want to be able to save my garden to file
- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my garden from file
